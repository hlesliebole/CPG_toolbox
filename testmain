The empirical relationship between shoreline changes and incident wave energy or energy flux has been studied across many time and space scales.  In California, erosion occurs in response to energetic winter waves during strong El Niños (Storlazzi and Griggs 1998, Barnard et al. 2011, Barnard et al. 2015, Doria et al. 2016, Young et al. 2018). In a comprehensive analysis of teleconnections between ENSO, ERA5 wave power anomalies, and shoreline change, Vos et al. 2023 further links the wave climate to observed interannual cycles of both beach loss and recovery throughout the Pacific Basin, using Landsat satellite-derived shorelines (CoastSat, Vos et al. 2019) and the ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis wave hindcast (﻿Copernicus Climate Change Service [C3S] 2017).  Vitousek et al. 2023 use CoastSat to examine long-term CA shoreline evolution, which is characterized by alternating alongshore reaches of shoreline widening and narrowing, or beach rotations, the result of decadal variations in wave-driven longshore transport (Anderson et al. 2018) restricted by geologic (headlands) and engineered features (harbors, large jetties). 
 
On interannual and ocean basin scales, Adams et al. 2008 and Bromirski et al. 2013 describe decadal trends in the North Pacific waves, aligned with cold and warm phases of the PDO, that potentially modulate El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) wave climate variability and CA shoreline change trends.  Here, we build upon this previous work by focusing on correlated interannual shoreline and wave power changes on the CA coastline.  Underlying CA's geographically complex seasonal (< 1 yr) shoreline variations (Adusumilli et al. 2024, Warrick et al. 2025), and superimposed on decadal (>> 1 yr) alongshore rotation trends, is markedly coherent statewide interannual cross-shore beach widening and narrowing.  To highlight this interannual shoreline covariability, Landsat shoreline positions and the ERA5 wave power hindcast are reduced to annual means (October through September) and compared using empirical orthogonal function analysis and ESTELA (Evaluation of Source and Travel-time of wave Energy reaching a Local Area, Pérez et al. 2014). 

Tide corrected Landsat shoreline positions spanning 37 years (1985-2021, CoastSat, Vos et al. 2019) are reduced to seasonally weighted annual means (October through September, hereafter   <CAcoastSat>) to isolate interannual change.  We reduce CoastSat errors by averaging shoreline positions across time and alongshore distances (Figure 1a). This approach minimizes artifacts from image digitization, wave runup, and irregular sampling. Similarly, field survey errors due to sparse sampling are reduced through averaging.  <CAcoastSat> agrees with similarly averaged annual mean, mean high water (MHW) shoreline elevation location anomalies obtained from in situ surveys at 5 beaches in San Diego County (Ludka et al. 2018, Ludka et al. 2019, Ludka et al. 2023).  Annual mean shoreline changes from Landsat and surveys have similar El Niño year erosion (2010, 2016), interannual variability, and localized widening from sand nourishments at Imperial Beach, Cardiff, and Solana Beach starting in 2012-13 (Figure 1b).  Coherent <CAcoastSat> multi-year shoreline beach loss and recovery patterns at many beaches across CA are apparent using the annual and beach-scale alongshore averaging (Figure 1c).

Buoy observations show the CA offshore annual wave power climate increases 25% from south to north in the mean, but the interannual variation of the power anomaly is spatially homogeneous (Figure 2c). Offshore wave power from the ECMWF ERA5 wave hindcast model estimate (i.e. ERA5 vector wave energy flux, units m3/s) offshore of south-central CA is validated against 2001-2021 Datawell Directional Waverider deep water buoy observations (see Methods). North Pacific swell (peak direction 300o and peak frequency 0.07 Hz) dominate the offshore annual wave power anomaly variability (Figure 2d).  

A Hovmöller diagram of shoreline change (Figure 3a) illustrates coherent statewide beach narrowing during El Niño years with large positive power anomalies (e.g. 1998, 2010, 2016, red years, Figure 3a), and broadening over negative power anomaly periods between El Niños (e.g. 2011-2014, blue years).  Shoreline change averaged statewide, and for northern CA (San Luis Obispo to Del Norte Counties, north of Pt. Conception) and southern CA (including a section of northern Baja California) emphasize the strikingly similar statewide response (Figure 3b).
Statewide patterns of <CAcoastSat> shoreline change, the difference between sequential annual means, are inversely correlated with wave power change (r2 = 0.72, Figure 3b).  North-south differences are most evident prior to the 1997-98 El Niño. 

To highlight variability owing to beach rotations, the 37-yr <CAcoastSat> dataset is divided into transects with cumulative widening or retreat since 1985 (Figure 3c, d).  The cumulative mean change associated with the near-equal number of eroding (blue line, 51%) and accreting (red line, 49%) transects is substantial (+/- 15m, Figure 3c) and consistent with the littoral cell-scale changes described by Vitousek et al. 2023.  When viewed as statewide means, the present era of beach rotations within the littoral cells appears to have started in earnest after the 1997-98 El Niño, or at the onset of the current PDO cold phase using the climatic North Pacific wave power delineation of Bromirski et al. 2013 (black arrow, Figure 3c).

The symmetric distributions of transects that have cumulatively eroded or accreted (Figure 3d) essentially cancel each other out in the statewide mean (black line, Figure 3c).  We anticipated a negative 1985-2021 trend owing to the reduction of sand supply from rivers and increased armoring of coastal cliffs (Inman and Frautschy 1966, Runyan and Griggs 2003, Patsch and Griggs 2006, Slagel and Griggs 2008).  Instead, the Landsat data indicates that the CA-wide annual mean shoreline position has varied roughly +/-7m since 1985, with an underlying positive linear trend of 0.11 m/yr (dotted black line, Figure 3c).  We explore this result, along with the unexpectedly coherent component of statewide shoreline recovery, with an empirical orthogonal function analysis of the <CAcoastSat> Hovmöller diagram (Figure 3a).

Dominant statewide patterns of annually averaged CA shoreline change are identified with empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of time series with the time mean removed at each transect and a 5-km running mean.  The first two EOF modes account for 45.8% and 5.8% of the total shoreline change variance.  The mode 1 spatial pattern is mostly positive with considerable longshore variability, indicating in-phase covariations of varying amplitude (Figure 4a,b).  Mode 1 has notably weak amplitudes in parts of Southern California, presumably due to wave shadowing caused by the shoreline orientation change south of Point Conception and sheltering by offshore islands (Pawka 1993, O’Reilly and Guza 1993).  Mode 1 is well-correlated with ERA5 (r2  =??,**).  Mode 2 represents regional deviations from the dominant statewide shoreline response, with the strongest anomalies in Southern California. This mode primarily reflects localized effects, particularly in the early Landsat record (1988–1992), when significant spatial differences in shoreline change were observed between northern and southern California (Figure 4d,e).  Various measures of wave power variations across the state using the buoy data and ERA5 hindcasts were unable to account for mode 2 change. 
 
The statewide average does not necessarily reflect change at a specific beach or littoral cell (eg. Warrick et al. 2023).  For example, shoreline width trends in San Diego Count vary from beach to beach (Figure 1b).  The large (54% of shoreline change variance) residual change at higher spatial resolution reflects local longshore transport, sand supply (including nourishments), and grain size and beach orientation effects.

CA wave hindcast backtracking with ESTELA (Pérez et al. 2014, Anderson et al 2018) identifies the primary north and south Pacific source regions of below and above average wave power for different <CAcoastSat> mode 1 and ENSO phases (Figure 5, see methods).  We use the hourly wind sea wave partition from the CACWR wave hindcast (Durrant et al. 2014, Smith et al.2020) to analyze the relationships between the wave generation areas and  shoreline change. The composite generation averages (Figure 5) are based on the more significant positive and negative years (index over or below the 75th and 25th percentile) for mode 1 (Figure 5a-c), and similarly the Niño3.4 index (Figure 5d-f). 

The energy generation anomaly displays a clear positive/negative anomaly in the same northern hemisphere (winter) source region during the negative/positive (beach recovery/loss) phases of mode 1 (Figure 5a-c), i.e., more energetic wave generation in the source region corresponds to narrower CA shorelines and vice versa.  A composite using the Niño3.4 index shows a similar positive northern hemisphere energy anomaly pattern as negative mode 1 during El Niño years (Figure 5 c,d), but below normal northern hemisphere wave energy does not reciprocally occur during La Niña Years (Figure 5f), with a more modest above average energy source region displaced northward towards Alaska compared to El Niño years.  The correspondence of erosion with El Niño events is well known; however, we find weak correlation in general with the ENSO index (r2 = 0.32) because both El Niños and La Niñas are associated with positive North Pacific wave power anomalies (Figure 5g).  This suggests that the below normal northern hemisphere energy years in (Figure 5a,b), associated with mode 1 Landsat shoreline recovery, primarily occur during ENSO neutral years (Figure 5e, 25th quantile < Niño3.4 index < 75th quantile).

The ERA5 wave hindcast (1940-2023)  is used to construct an 82-yr hindcast of the statewide average annual "wave-driven" mean shoreline change based on the linear regression of 1985-2021 annual ERA5 offshore wave power against statewide averaged <CAcoastSat> (Figure 6).  The hindcast shoreline position using wave ERA5 (black dashed line, Figure 6b) compares well with the Landsat shoreline (green dotted line), but underestimates 1984-1987 shoreline retreat and 2012-2015 recovery.  Landsat shoreline imagery was relatively low spatial resolution and temporally sparse in the 1980's and 1990's, perhaps contributing to  larger model errors.  
 
The 82yr shoreline trends negative (black solid line, -0.054 ± 0.03 m/yr, Figure 6b) with a statewide average shoreline retreat of ~ 4m since 1940, despite the more recent 1985-2021 period of mean shoreline position stability or slight widening derived from the Landsat images (green lines, Figure 6b). Retreat is more consistent with the perception of long-term shoreline erosion, particularly after the extensive pre-1960 artificial widening of CA beaches with harbor constructions (Flick 1993, Patsch and Griggs 2006). This wave-driven estimate does not consider sand supply changes (river inputs, nourishments).  Alternating multi-decadal time periods of modeled statewide accretive and erosive shoreline trends (negative and positive ERA5 wave power trends) align with cold (1947-1976, 2000-present) and warm (1977-1999) phases of the PDO (Figure 6).  The observed widening over the 1999-2021 cold PDO may not be indicative of long-term shoreline change. 

Following Adams et al. 2008 and Bromirski et al. 2013 by parsing the hindcast into PDO cold and warm phases (blue and red shaded time periods, Figure 6), the power and shoreline trends are positive/negative in cold/warm phases (purple trends lines, Figure 6).  The hindcast of the recent (2000-2021) cold phase trends compare favorably with the observed buoy (red solid line, Figure 6a) and <CAcoastSat> (green solid line, Figure 6b) trends.  The PDO cold/warm phases are defined by the sign of the PDO index after applying a 5-yr running mean to the monthly PDO index to suppress ENSO modulation of the PDO signal (Mantua et al. 1997, Bromirski et al. 2003, Adams et al. 2008).

Analogous to seasonal beach change in CA (Adusumilli et al. 2024, Warrick et al. 2025), mode 1 represents the cross-shore transport and storage of sand on interannual time scales.  During energetic wave years sand moves offshore and the shoreline narrows until subsequent annual mean wave conditions favor shoreward transport.  The Landsat estimates of more extreme annual beach loss (1985-1987) and recovery (2011-2013), associated with consecutive years of above or below average wave power, are underpredicted by an ERA5 regression hindcast model (Figure 6).  These errors are possibly an interannual cross-shore sand distribution analog to shoreline evolution model errors owing to missing seasonal bar dynamics (Ferreira et al. 2024).  The finding that this onshore-offshore exchange has a mode 1 statewide coherent expression tied to the offshore wave climate, despite significant nearshore wave climate mean energy variation owing to island sheltering and coastal orientations, is notable.  This suggests that the larger/smaller self-selected grain sizes associated with higher/lower energy beaches partially normalizes regional interannual cross-shore behavior.  

These findings have direct implications for coastal management and long-term hazard mitigation along the California coast.  A CA shoreline climatic index based on the expected sign and strength of the central North Pacific winter wave power anomaly could provide annual guidance for shoreline managers.  Anticipated beach recovery phases during neutral ENSO conditions could guide the timing of shoreline protection and restoration projects. While our results indicate no significant net statewide shoreline loss over the past 37 years, the long-term wave-driven retreat trend underscores the vulnerability of California’s beaches to changing climatic conditions. As sea level rise accelerates beach erosion through the end of the century, integrating interannual wave-driven shoreline behavior into resilience planning will be critical for protecting coastal infrastructure, ecosystems, and recreational spaces.
