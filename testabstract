Our understanding of how wave climate variability drives shoreline evolution has advanced substantially in recent decades with increasing satellite imagery, wave buoy records, and wave hindcast models. While severe beach erosion with extreme El Niño waves is well documented, , the broader link between interannual wave energy and shoreline response has remained less clear.  Here, we show nearly half of California's interannual Landsat shoreline variability is a coherent response to wave power anomalies originating from a specific central North Pacific swell generation region. Shoreline change is poorly correlated with the Niño3.4 index because both El Niños and La Niñas have positive energy anomalies in the generation area. Cumulative change in the CA statewide mean shoreline position is small over the 37-yr Landsat observations but an 83-yr wave hindcast suggests a statewide wave-driven retreat of ~ 4m loss since 1941.  These results provide additional insight into the role of wave climate trends and anomalies in modulating beach width over interannual to multi-decadal timescales, with implications for long-term coastal resilience.
